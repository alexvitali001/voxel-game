cube game

## Qs

**What's with the name?**
I (as in, Bazinga_9000) couldn't think of a good name for this, and so called it "cube game" in the early stages. I eventually decided to just name it "cube game" in my conlang, because I am apparently better at making conlangs than naming this project.

**How do you pronounce that?**
Phonemically /dir̥ɬaku:/, phonetically [dit͡ɬaku:]. Either works.
